## viewmo: A Chatbot UI for React and Next.js

**viewmo** is a comprehensive npm module designed to simplify the integration of chatbot functionality within your React and Next.js applications. It provides a robust and customizable `<Chat>` component that streamlines the creation of user-friendly chat interfaces.

## Installation

To incorporate **viewmo** into your project, simply utilize npm:

```bash
npm install viewmo
```

## Usage

**viewmo** empowers you to seamlessly integrate a chat interface into your React application. Here's a step-by-step guide:

**1. Secure Credential Management:**

For enhanced security, **viewmo** leverages environment variables to store your chat credentials. Create a file named `.env.local` at the root of your project. Inside this file, define the following environment variables, replacing the placeholders with your actual credentials:

```
REACT_APP_USERNAME=your_username
REACT_APP_PASSWORD=your_password
```

**2. Importing and Utilizing the `<Chat>` Component:**

Within your React component, import the `<Chat>` component from **viewmo** and leverage it as follows:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Chat from 'viewmo';

const App = () => {
  // Retrieve credentials securely from environment variables
  const username = process.env.REACT_APP_USERNAME;
  const password = process.env.REACT_APP_PASSWORD;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Your Chat Interface</h1>
      <Chat username={username} password={password} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

**Explanation:**

* We import React and Chat from viewmo.
* We securely retrieve the username and password from environment variables to safeguard sensitive information.
* We render the `<Chat>` component, passing the retrieved credentials as props to configure the chat functionality.

**3. Comprehensive Example: Putting it All Together**

The following example demonstrates the complete setup and usage of the `<Chat>` component in your project:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import Chat from 'viewmo';

const App = () => {
  // Retrieve credentials securely from environment variables
  const username = process.env.REACT_APP_USERNAME;
  const password = process.env.REACT_APP_PASSWORD;

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Your Chat Interface</h1>
      <Chat username={username} password={password} />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

**Important Note:**

Remember to create the `.env.local` file at the project root and define the environment variables with your specific credentials:

```
REACT_APP_USERNAME=your_username
REACT_APP_PASSWORD=your_password
```
